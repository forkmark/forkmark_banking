# API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/`. The `/api/v1/` prefix is also supported as an alias.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require an API key via the `X-API-Key` header. SDK endpoints always require it. UI read endpoints may be unauthenticated in single-tenant mode (controlled by `FM_REQUIRE_UI_AUTH`).

See [Authentication](authentication.md) for details.

## SDK endpoints

These are used by the ForkMark SDK and always require API key authentication.

## Rate limiting

All endpoints are rate-limited at 1000 requests per minute per API key (or per client IP for unauthenticated endpoints). Rate limiting uses Redis sorted sets when available, with a local in-memory fallback.

When rate-limited, endpoints return `429 Too Many Requests`.
