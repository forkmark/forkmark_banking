"""Shared pytest fixtures.

Test isolation: several suites mutate process-global environment variables
directly via ``os.environ`` (e.g. ``FM_ENABLE_AGENT_COMPARISON``) to exercise
feature gating. Without cleanup those values leak into later tests and cause
order-dependent failures that only show up in a full single-process run (CI),
not when running one file at a time. This autouse fixture snapshots and restores
``os.environ`` around every test so the suite is order-independent.

# ForkMark defaults FM_REQUIRE_UI_AUTH to `true` (secure-by-default; mandatory for
# financial-institution deployments — see config.py). The functional test suite
# exercises the read/write UI endpoints without provisioning an API key per test,
# so it explicitly opts into open mode here. This assignment runs at conftest
# import time — before any test module imports backend/config — so the singleton
# ``config.REQUIRE_UI_AUTH`` (read once at import) picks it up. Auth-gate behaviour
# is covered separately by tests that drive deps.require_key directly.
os.environ.setdefault("FM_REQUIRE_UI_AUTH", "false")
